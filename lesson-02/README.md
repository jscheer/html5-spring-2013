SRJC CS50.12 Section 5371

I chose to attempt to "Convert an existing HTML page to proper structural/sectioning markup."

The page I chose was a Dreamweaver template page that was used to create my final project

last semester. I hope to be able to build a similar page without the need to rely on Dreamweaver

specifically.


It was hard to get started, letting go of old ways and not being at all comfortable with how to

officially move forward. The reading helped me get into it and clean house. It was liberating to

strip out all the extras, or house of cards, that I used on the final project. The page is

basically broken, noo images, CSS, javascript, php, responsiveness, just html. But the outline is

good, and now I have a solid foundation to move forward.


I stripped out all the Dreamweaver template code, and reduced it to bare bones.

I was able to update many of the div tags to html semantic tags. There were a few places that I

am still struggling with to define a proper tag, but overall, the structure of the page outline

is clear, and renders without any untitled tags. I added the HTML5 Outloner extension in Chrome.


I used the follwong tags so far in my update:

- section
- article
- nav
- hgroup
- h1
- footer

I still kept a few div tags that were originally only used for layout, and from the reading, 

I should expect that. They don't get in the way of the structure or outline. I hope the be able

to remove or change more elements as we learn more in the class.
